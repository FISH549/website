# Background

We saw [last time](lec_20_markdown_1.html) how to work with some of the basic formatting options when creating `.pdf` files in **R Markdown**. Here we will learn about some of the more advanced formatting options for creating nice looking documents. You should download the blank `.Rmd` template [here](lec_21_blank_template.Rmd), which contains some random text and other output options.

***

# Basic info

The basic information in the `YAML` of a blank `.Rmd` document set for `.pdf` output includes the following

```{r yaml, eval = FALSE}
title: "A catchy title"
author: "First Last"
date: "19 February 2021"
output: pdf_document
```

You can also add a subtitle with the `subtitle` argument and set the data to automatically update with the inline **R** code `r Sys.Date()`. You can create a custom format for the date as well. For example, the following `date` option will print as `day full_month_name four_digit_year`. Check out the options for `format()` to see how to change the date format.

```{r yaml_2, eval = FALSE}
title: "A catchy title"
subtitle: "A pithy subtitle"
author: "First Last"
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B %Y')`"
output: pdf_document
```

# Document layout

The default document layout for `.pdf` files in **R Markdown** is pretty good, but there are some options to improve it. These options are specified primarily in the document's `YAML`, but some of them will be placed in the "chunk options" within **R** code blocks.

## Appearance

We can change the overall appearance or *class* of the document with the `documentclass` argument, which you set in the `YAML`. Here are some of the options.

### Article

The `article` class is a basic layout that has relatively large margins.

```{r article, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output: pdf_document
documentclass: article
```

### Report

The `report`` class will create a separate title page and insert page breaks between level-one section headings. It also has relatively large margins.

```{r report, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output: pdf_document
documentclass: report
```

### Two columns

You can create a document with two columns of text with the `classoption` argument. For example, here is an article with two columns.

```{r twocolumn, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output: pdf_document
documentclass: report
classoption: twocolumn
```


## Margins

You can set the margin spacing to be the same for all four sides, or set each of them separately, with the `geometry` argument. Here is an example of setting all of the margins in an `article` to 1.5 inches. (Note that you can also use metric units for margins.)

```{r margins_1, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output: pdf_document
documentclass: article
geometry: margin=1.5in
```

Here's an example of setting the top and bottom margins in an `article` to 1 inch and the left and right margins to 1.25 inches. Notice that when using multiple settings in an arguments, we need to set them on separate lines preceded by a dash `-`.

```{r margins_2, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output: pdf_document
documentclass: article
geometry:
- top=1in
- bottom=1in
- left=1.25in
- right=1.25in
```

## Line spacing

You can increase the line spacing with the `linestretch` argument. For example, here is an `article` with 1-inch margins and double line spacing.

```{r line_spacing, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output: pdf_document
documentclass: article
geometry: margin=1in
linestretch: 2
```

## Line numbers

You can add line numbers to `.pdf` documents, but it involves using an additional **LaTeX** package call `lineno`. To use additional **LaTeX** packages, you have to use the `header-includes` argument in the `YAML`. Specifically, it looks like this for a double-spaced `article` with 1-inch margins:

```{r line_numbers, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output: pdf_document
documentclass: article
geometry: margin=1in
linestretch: 2
header-includes:
  - \usepackage{lineno}
  - \linenumbers
```


## Fonts

### Size

You can set the font size in your document with the `fontsize` argument. For example, here is a double-spaced `article` with 1-inch margins and 12-point font.

```{r font_size, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output: pdf_document
documentclass: article
geometry: margin=1in
linestretch: 2
fontsize: 12pt
```

### Family

You can change the font family, but doing so depends on the **LaTeX** engine you are using. You can check this by examining the **Global options** in **RStudio**. To do so, from the main menu options click on `Tools > Global Opotions...` In the dialogue box, select the `Sweave` option on the left and look at the `Typeset LaTeX into PDF using:` setting.

![](images/rs_global_options.png)

If you are using `pdflatex`, you can use the `fontfamily` argument to select a **LaTeX** font package to be loaded in your document to change the font. Also note that this requires you to use multi-line option specification for `output` like we saw for `geometry` above.

```{r font_fam_1, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output:
  pdf_document: 
    latex_engine: pdflatex
fontfamily: Arial
documentclass: article
geometry: margin=1in
linestretch: 2
fontsize: 12pt
```

Then the document will use the Arial font. If your **LaTeX** distribution is **TinyTeX** and the required font packages have not been installed, they should be automatically installed when the document is compiled.

If you use the **LaTeX** engine **xelatex** or **lualatex**, you will be able to select fonts that are available on your local computer, and do not have to install additional LaTeX packages. To do so, use the `mainfont` argument like this:

```{r font_fam_2, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output:
  pdf_document: 
    latex_engine: xelatex
mainfont: Arial
documentclass: article
geometry: margin=1in
linestretch: 2
fontsize: 12pt
```

# Front matter

You can add so-call *front matter* to your document, such as a table of contents.

## Table of contents

To automatically create a table of contents, set the `toc` argument to `true`. You can control how many heading levels you want to display in the table of contents with the `toc-depth` argument. For example, here is a double-spaced `report` with 1-inch margins, 12-point font, and a table of contents that shows the first two heading levels.

```{r toc, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output: pdf_document
documentclass: report
geometry: margin=1in
linestretch: 2
fontsize: 12pt
toc: TRUE
toc-depth: 2
```

## Document version

For some documents, I prefer to set a custom *version* number based on the date rather than set the `date` argument explicitly. To do so, simply include a line in the *main document* similar to something like this:

```{r version, eval = FALSE}
This is version `r paste0('0.',format(Sys.time(), '%y.%m.%d'))`.
```

that will render to

"This is version `r paste0('0.',format(Sys.time(), '%y.%m.%d'))`."

# Figure placement

Unlike Microsoft Word, in which figures are placed directly where the user specifies, **LaTeX** will attempt to place a figure in a position that does not violate certain typographic rules. Thus, figures may "float away" from where they are referenced in the text. These so-called *floats* are used as containers for figures (and tables) that cannot be broken across pages.

In *R Markdown**, figures are actually generated with the figure environment in **LaTeX**. For example, Pandoc will convert the following Markdown code for specifying an image

```
![This is an image.](images/my_picture.jpg)
```

to the following **LaTeX** code:

```
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{images/cool.jpg}
  \caption{This is an image.}
\end{figure}
```

If the figure or table cannot be contained in the space left on the current page, **LaTeX** will try to place it at the top of the next page. If the figure is tall enough, it may occupy the whole next page, even if there is still space left for a few lines of text. The float's behavior can be controlled by using placement controls in square brackets like `\begin{figure}[]`. Here are some possible controls:

* `h`: Place the float here (or close to it)    
* `t`: Position at the top of the page  
* `b`: Position at the bottom of the page  
* `p`: Put on a special page for floats only  

You can override the default placement by prefacing the control with an exclamation point (eg, `[!t]`).

If you want to place the float at *exactly the location* in the **LaTeX** code, you will need to include a call to the `float` package in the `YAML` and then set the `fig.pos = "!H"` chunk option in the code block. For example,

```{r float, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output: pdf_document
documentclass: article
geometry: margin=1in
linestretch: 2
fontsize: 12pt
toc: TRUE
toc-depth: 2
header-includes:
  - \usepackage{float}
```

# Sub-figures

Sometimes you may want to include multiple images in a single figure environment. Sub-figures allow us to achieve this by arranging multiple images within a single environment and providing each with its own sub-caption. Sub-figures require the **LaTeX** package `subfig`, which you can call in the `YAML`, such as

```{r subfigs, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output: pdf_document
documentclass: article
geometry: margin=1in
linestretch: 2
fontsize: 12pt
toc: TRUE
toc-depth: 2
header-includes:
  - \usepackage{subfig}
```

To arrange all plots from a code chunk into sub-figures, you have to set the following chunk options

* `fig.cap`: the caption for the whole figure environment

* `fig.subcap`: a `character` vector of the captions for each of the sub-figures

In addition, you will probably want to set the following options

* `fig.ncol`: number of columns of sub-figures (by default, all plots are arranged in a single row)

* `out.width`: output width of individual plots, which normally equals 100% divided by the number of columns

For example, this code chunk will produce 3 subplots:

````
`r ''````{r subplot, fig.cap='A figure with 3 subplots.', fig.subcap=c('The numbers 1 through 10.', 'Speed versus distance.', 'Time series of white noise.'), fig.ncol = 2, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
plot(1:10, pch = 16)
plot(cars)
plot.ts(rnorm(30))
```
````

# Headers & footers

You can use the **LaTeX** package `fancyhdr` to customize the header and footer of your document. As with other packages, we have to first make a call to it in the `YAML` and set the additional argument `\pagestyle{fancy}`.

```{r headfoot, eval = FALSE}
title: "Example template for exploring formatting options"
author: "First Last"
date: "2/19/2021"
output: pdf_document
documentclass: article
geometry: margin=1in
linestretch: 2
fontsize: 12pt
toc: TRUE
toc-depth: 2
header-includes:
- \usepackage{fancyhdr}
```

The syntax for the formatting is `\fancyhead[selectors]{output text}`, where `selectors` specify the part of the header that we wish to customize. We can use the following selectors for the page locators:

* `E` for even pages  
* `O` for odd pages  
* `L` for the left side  
* `C` for the center  
* `R` for the right side  

For example, `\fancyhead[LE,RO]{First Last}` will print the text “First Last” on the left side of the header for even pages, and the right side for odd pages. We can combine this with additional LaTeX commands to extract details from our document for each page:

* `\thepage`: the number of the current page    
* `\thechapter`: the number of the current chapter  
* `\thesection`: the number of the current section  
* `\chaptername`: the word “Chapter” in English, or its equivalent in the current language, or the text that the author specified by redefining this command  
* `\leftmark`: the name and number of the current top-level structure in uppercase letters  
* `\rightmark`: the name and number of the current next to top-level structure in uppercase letters  

For example, the following code will place the text "The document header" at the top center of all pages, "A fancy footer" at the bottom center of all pages, and the page number on the left of even pages and right of odd pages

```
\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhead[CO,CE]{The document header}
\fancyfoot[CO,CE]{A fancy footer}
\fancyfoot[LE,RO]{\thepage}
```

By default, headers and footers are not displayed on the first page of a `.pdf` document. If you want to include them, use this line `\fancypagestyle{plain}{\pagestyle{fancy}}`.
