## Goals for today

* Outline the steps to a data science analysis

> - Understand the software requirements for the course

## Steps to an analysis

1. Define the question  
2. Get the data  
3. Clean the data  
4. Explore the data  
5. Fit statistical models  
6. Communicate the results

## Steps to an analysis | 1. Define the question of interest  

What makes a good Q?

> - It should be specific  
> - It should be answerable with available data
> - It should come with a definition of success  
> - It should not be designed to discriminate or cause harm


## Steps to an analysis | 2. Get the data  

Data sources (in order of confidence):

> - You collected your own  
> - Collaborators  
> - Public repositories


## Steps to an analysis | 3. Clean the data  

This is usually the most time intensive step

It's also the most important & the hardest to teach

## Steps to an analysis | 4. Explore the data  

Do the data meet your expectations?

> - Make judicious use of plots

> - Also consider correlation matrics (eg, [{corrplot}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html))

> - Beware of data mining!


## Steps to an analysis | 5. Fit statistical models  

Start with first principles

> - Type of data (discrete, continuous)

> - Distributions of data (normal, Poisson)

> - Start simple and build from it!


## Steps to an analysis | 6. Communicate the results  

Who's your audience? What's your medium?

> - Lab group

> - Social media, blog posts

> - Presentation

> - Publication


## Steps to an analysis | Make your analysis reproducible  

Consider these real scenarios

> - Your collaborator asks, "Can you re-run the analysis with these new data?"

> - "Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, but you donâ€™t reply to emails." (Karl Broman)


# Types of analyses


## Types of analysis | Raw

The goal is to explore the data 

This is your "sandbox"


## Types of analysis | Informal

Soften the edges of the raw results

> - Focus the analysis or "refine the arc"

> - Improve the presentation

> - Narrow your conclusions

## Types of analysis | Formal

A refined analysis and presentation

> - Code in supplementary materials (**GitHub**, **Zenodo**, **figshare**)

> - High quality figures


## A rubric for analyses

Here are some useful questions to ask yourself


## A rubric for analyses | Answering the question posed

> - Could the question be answered with the available data?

> - Did you understand the context for the question and the scientific application?

> - Did you record the experimental design?


## A rubric for analyses | Cleaning the data

> - Are the data "tidy"?

> - Did you record the recipe for moving from raw to tidy data?

> - Did you record all parameters, units, and functions applied to the data?


## A rubric for analyses | Exploratory analysis

> - Did you make univariate plots (histograms, density plots, boxplots)?

> - Did you consider correlations between variables (scatterplots)?

> - Did you check the units of all data points to make sure they are in the right range?

> - Did you try to identify any errors or miscoding of variables?


## A rubric for analyses | Statistical analysis

> - Did you identify the quantities of interest in your model?

> - How did you select your model(s) (eg, information theory, cross validation)?

> - Is this a correlative or causative study?


## A rubric for analyses | Communication

> - Did you describe the data set, experimental design, and question you are answering?

> - Did you specify the model you are fitting?

> - Does each table/figure communicate an important piece of information?


## A rubric for analyses | Reproducibility

> - Did you create a script that reproduces all your analyses?

> - Did you save the raw and processed versions of your data?

> - Did you record all versions of the software you used to process the data?

> - Did you try to have someone else run your analysis code?


## What's next?

We'll learn about research compendia and style conventions for coding and naming
