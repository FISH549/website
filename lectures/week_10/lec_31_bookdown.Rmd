# Publishing an e-book

Now that we've seen how to create a simple HTML report using R Markdown and display it online, let's build upon those skills and see how to publish an electronic book ("e-book") so that it can be shared with and viewed by others. To do so, we'll make use of the [{bookdown}](https://bookdown.org/) package, which is what Mark uses for his [lab guide](https://scheuerell-lab.github.io/lab-book/index.html). You can see many other examples of different books written with {bookdown} [here](https://bookdown.org/home/archive/).

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** If you haven't done so already, install the {bookdown} package. Load it when done.
</div>

```{r install_bookdown}
## install bookdown if necessary
## install.packages("bookdown")

## load bookdown
library("bookdown")
```


## Create a new repo

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Navigate to GitHub and create a new _public_ repo called `book-demo`. Add a `README.md` file and an R `.gitignore` file as well (you can skip a license file). CLick the green **Create repository** button when you're ready.

</div>
