## Goals for today

* Understand the elements of a *research compendium*

> - Understand conventions for coding styles



## The reproducibility crisis in science

We are witnessing an increasing number of examples where the original analysis cannot be reproduced

> - For example, a group of Amgen scientists could only confirm the results in 6 out of 53 cancer studies (Begley & Ellis 2012) 


## What does it mean to be reproducible?

According to the National Science Foundation:

_The calculation of quantitative scientific results by independent researchers using the original data and methods_


## What does it mean to be reproducible?

Reproducibility can be further broken down

> - empirical (eg, sample IDs, sampling gear, instrument settings)

> - statistical (eg, which statistical tests, what model parameters)

> - computational (eg, code, software, hardware)


## What is a research compendium?

_A standard and easily recognizable way for organizing the digital materials of a project to enable others to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research._

Marwick et al. (2018)


## 3 principles of research compendia

1. Project organization should follow the conventions of the scientific community

    > - The community might be a lab group

    > - The convention(s) support tool building


## 3 principles of research compendia

1. Project organization should follow the conventions of the scientific community

2. Maintain a clear separation of data, methods and output

    > - Separate data from code

    > - Separate cleaning, analysis & output code


## Example file structure

```
|-code
  |-01_data-ingest.R
  |-02_data-cleaning.R
  |-03_data-QAQC.R
  |-04_model-fitting.R
  |-05_create-figures.R
|-data
  |-skagit_steelhead-escapement.csv
  |-skagit_river-flow.csv
```



## 3 principles of research compendia

1. Project organization should follow the conventions of the scientific community

2. Maintain a clear separation of data, methods and output

3. Specify the computational environment

    > - Which software/package(s) and what version(s)?

    > - Ranges from simple text description to self-contained environments


## Why use a research compendium?

> - Increased efficiency, simplified file management and streamlined workflows

> - Increased visibility and scientific impact

> - Ability to return later and understand the process


## Creating a research compendium | Key principle

Organize your compendium so another person knows what to expect from the plain meaning of the file and directory names


## Simple compendium {data-background=images/compendium_1.png data-background-size=40% data-background-position=50%60% .citation}

Marwick et al (2018)


## Simple compendium {data-background=images/compendium_2.png data-background-size=35% data-background-position=50%60% .citation}

Marwick et al (2018)


## Medium<br>compendium {data-background=images/compendium_3.png data-background-size=30% data-background-position=50%50% .citation}

Marwick et al (2018)


## Large<br>compendium {data-background=images/compendium_4.png data-background-size=25% data-background-position=50%50% .citation}

Marwick et al (2018)


## Sharing a research compendium | 4 things to consider

1. Licensing

    > - Who can (re)use the work?

    > - Are there restrictions?

    > - Many depositories require Creative Commons licenses


## Sharing a research compendium | 4 things to consider

1. Licensing

2. Version control

    > - Facilitates private collaboration among colleagues on the project

    > - Allows for distribution and maintenance of the compendium in the future


## Sharing a research compendium | 4 things to consider

1. Licensing

2. Version control

3. Persistence

    > - Consider the "life span" of the analysis
 
    > - A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is more permanent than a URL



## Sharing a research compendium | 4 things to consider

1. Licensing

2. Version control

3. Persistence

4. Metadata

    > - Publishing data with a DOI requires a description of the data themselves

    > - who, what, where, when, how


## Tools for creating a compendium

One could always create a structure from scratch

Alternatively, consider some existing tools

> - Jeff Hollister's [{manuscriptPackage}](https://github.com/jhollist/manuscriptPackage)

> - Carl Boettiger's [{template}](https://github.com/cboettig/template)

> - Ben Marwick's [{rrtools}](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools)

> - Scheuerell Lab's [compendium](https://github.com/scheuerell-lab/compendium-template)


# Coding styles


## A note on directory structure | Does your R code begin with something like this? 

`setwd("/Users/Mark/Documents/projects/salmon/final_code")`


## A note on directory structure | Does your R code begin with something like this?

`setwd("/Users/Mark/Documents/projects/salmon/final_code")`

<br>

<center>**Do you see any problems with this approach?**</center>


## A note on directory structure | Does your R code begin with something like this?

`setwd("/Users/Mark/Documents/projects/salmon/final_code")`

<br>

<center>**This won't work unless your directory structure matches mine!**</center>


## Relative vs absolute paths

Use relative paths to your work

The [{here}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/here/index.html) package makes this really easy

```
## Absolute path
## setwd("/Users/Mark/Documents/projects/salmon/data")

## Relative path
> data_dir <- here::here("salmon", data")
> data_dir
> [1] "/Users/Julio/research/thesis/salmon/data"
```


## File & code names | 3 principles

1. Human readable

    > - The name should convey concise info

    > - Longer is better


## File & code names | 3 principles

1. Human readable

2. Machine readable

    > - Easy to ID with *regular expressions* or *globbing*

    > - Avoid spaces, capitalization, punctuation, special characters

    > - Consider `_` and `-` as delimiters


## A cautionary tale from the real world

Consider all of these "special characters"

~`!@#$%^&()+={}[]|\:";'<,>.?/*


## A cautionary tale from the real world

Consider all of these "special characters"

~`!@#$%^&()+={}[]|\:";'<,>.?/*

<br>

Of them, the pipe | was the only character available for use as a delimiter in a plain text file for a statewide energy efficiency database **because all the others had been used in variable names**.


## Example file names | Bad

* `resume.docx`

* `Mark's data.xlsx`

* `figure 1.pdf`


## Example file names | Bad

* `resume.docx` -- whose?

* `Mark's data.xlsx` -- which project?

* `figure 1.pdf` -- of what?


## Example file names | Much better

* `scheuerell_resume_2025-01-03.docx`

* `marks_skagit_steelhead_age-composition.xlsx`

* `figure-01_scatterplot-length-mass.pdf`


## File & code names | 3 principles

1. Human readable

2. Machine readable

3. Works with default ordering

    > - Use a number at the beginning of a name

    > - Use the ISO standard for dates (YYYY-MM-DD)

    > - "zero-pad" numbers


## Example file names | Chronological order

```
2019-10-20_skagit_harvest-commerical.csv

2019-10-20_skagit_harvest-recreational.csv

2020-09-18_nooksack_harvest-commerical.csv

2020-09-18_nooksack_harvest-recreational.csv
```


## Example file names | Logical order

```
01_data-ingest.R

02_data-cleaning.R

03_data-QAQC.R

04_model-fitting.R

05_create-figures.R
```

## An investment rather than an order

Taking the time to invest in these styles and strategies can save you a lot of time in the future, but in the end it's up to you


## What's next?

We'll learn about GitHub and how to use it for personal and collaborative projects
