## Goals for today

* Outline the steps to a data science analysis

> - Understand the software requirements for the course

This content draws upon material developed by Jeff Leek & Roger Peng for their Advanced Data Science Course at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.


## Steps to an analysis

1. Define the question  
2. Get the data  
3. Clean the data  
4. Explore the data  
5. Fit statistical models  
6. Communicate the results

## Steps to an analysis | 1. Define the question of interest  

What makes a good Q?

> - It should be specific  
> - It should be answerable with available data
> - It should come with a definition of success  
> - It should not be designed to discriminate or cause harm


## Steps to an analysis | 2. Get the data  

Data sources (in order of confidence):

> - You collected your own  
> - Collaborators  
> - Public repositories


## Steps to an analysis | 3. Clean the data  

This is usually the most time intensive step

It's also the most important & the hardest to teach

## Steps to an analysis | 4. Explore the data  

Do the data meet your expectations?

> - Make judicious use of plots

> - Also consider correlation matrics (eg, [{corrplot}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html))

> - Beware of data mining!


## Steps to an analysis | 5. Fit statistical models  

Start with first principles

> - Type of data (discrete, continuous)

> - Distributions of data (normal, Poisson)

> - Start simple and build from it!


## Steps to an analysis | 6. Communicate the results  

Who's your audience? What's your medium?

> - Lab group

> - Social media, blog posts

> - Presentation

> - Publication


## Steps to an analysis | Make your analysis reproducible  

Consider these real scenarios

> - Your collaborator asks, "Can you re-run the analysis with these new data?"

> - "Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, but you donâ€™t reply to emails." (Karl Broman)


# Types of analyses


## Types of analysis | Raw

The goal is to explore the data 

This is your "sandbox"


## Types of analysis | Informal

Soften the edges of the raw results

> - Focus the analysis or "refine the arc"

> - Improve the presentation

> - Narrow your conclusions

## Types of analysis | Formal

A refined analysis and presentation

> - Code in supplementary materials (**GitHub**, **Zenodo**, **figshare**)

> - High quality figures


## A rubric for analyses

Here are some useful questions to ask yourself


## A rubric for analyses | Answering the question posed

> - Could the question be answered with the available data?

> - Did you understand the context for the question and the scientific application?

> - Did you record the experimental design?


## A rubric for analyses | Cleaning the data

> - Are the data "tidy"?

> - Did you record the recipe for moving from raw to tidy data?

> - Did you record all parameters, units, and functions applied to the data?


## A rubric for analyses | Exploratory analysis

> - Did you make univariate plots (histograms, density plots, boxplots)?

> - Did you consider correlations between variables (scatterplots)?

> - Did you check the units of all data points to make sure they are in the right range?

> - Did you try to identify any errors or miscoding of variables?


## A rubric for analyses | Statistical analysis

> - Did you identify the quantities of interest in your model?

> - How did you select your model(s) (eg, information theory, cross validation)?

> - Is this a correlative or causative study?


## A rubric for analyses | Communication

> - Did you describe the data set, experimental design, and question you are answering?

> - Did you specify the model you are fitting?

> - Does each table/figure communicate an important piece of information?


## A rubric for analyses | Reproducibility

> - Did you create a script that reproduces all your analyses?

> - Did you save the raw and processed versions of your data?

> - Did you record all versions of the software you used to process the data?

> - Did you try to have someone else run your analysis code?


# Software requirements


## Software in this course

1) Is free

2) Is well supported by the user community


## R Software | An environment for statistical computing and graphics

> - Enormous developer & support communities

> - [Learn more here](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)


## R packages

Most of R's current capabilities come from *packages*

> - We'll use a variety of them for many different tasks

> - We'll also learn how to create our own!


## RStudio | An integrated development environment (IDE) for R

> - Syntax highlighting, code completion, smart indentation  

> - Easily manage multiple working directories using projects  

> - Extensive package development tools  

> - Built-in tools & GUIs for **Git** & **R Markdown**


## &nbsp; {data-background=images/RStudio_desktop.png data-background-size=80%}


## RStudio benefits

### [Cheat sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

<br>

### [Webinars, links, etc](https://resources.rstudio.com/)


## &nbsp; {data-background=images/RStudio_cheatsheet.png data-background-size=80%}


## GitHub | Cloud-based code repository & collaboration platform

> - Store, manage, track changes to code

> - Communicate with other team members

> - Uses **Git** for version control


## &nbsp; {data-background=images/gh_signup.png data-background-size=80%}


## &nbsp; {data-background=images/GitHub_repo.png data-background-size=80%}


## Git | Version control system (VCS)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/about) records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later


## PostgreSQL | Open source relational database system

> - Uses & extends the SQL language

> - Highly extensible (eg, define your own data types)

> - Active user community


## R Markdown

Notebook interface to weave together text, equations, and code into nicely formatted output

Allows you to create and document fully reproducible workflows


## R Markdown

Supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats

* HTML  
* PDF  
* MS Word  
* HTML5 slides  
* Books  
* Shiny apps  
* Scientific articles  
* websites

## What's next?

We'll learn about research compendia and style conventions for coding and naming
