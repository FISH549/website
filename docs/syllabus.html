<div id="course-overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Course overview</h1>
<p>Science is about the discovery and sharing of information, but much
of the process is often shrouded in mystery. In some cases, questions
about what and how things were done have left other scientists unable to
successfully reproduce previous findings, bringing into question the
integrity of the results. Fortunately, however, we also find ourselves
in the midst of an expanding community of developers and practitioners
of the tools and skills necessary for more transparent design, analysis,
and reporting of scientific studies. These advancements have also
supported better documentation, management, and access to data, which
has facilitated new and often remote collaborations. This relatively new
field of “Data Science” is broadly defined, but generally combines
elements of data literacy, computer programming, statistics, and graphic
design. A data scientist is generally expected to identify relevant
questions, gather data from multiple sources, organize it, extract
meaningful information, and communicate the results to others.</p>
<p>This course will provide an overview of some data science tools and
best practices that can be used to create transparent and reproducible
workflows when working with environmental data. Students will learn how
to translate raw data from field and lab studies into databases and
“tidy” digital formats, which can then be used for plotting, statistical
analyses, etc. Students will learn how to track the history of file
changes (version control), collaborate online with others, and generate
“recipes” for re-creating one’s work. Although failure and frustration
in science are common, the open science community tries hard to be
welcoming and helpful. Thus, students will also learn how and where to
ask for help when attempting something new (<em>e.g.</em>, How do I
create X from Y?), debugging or fixing code (<em>e.g.</em>, What does
this error message mean?), etc.</p>
<p>Importantly, this course will also discuss the various types of data
used in environmental science, which includes an exploration of what
constitutes “raw” data versus derived products, and the implications of
using the various types. The course will also focus on the ethical and
social consequences of using various data types. For example, some
recent studies have inferred gender identities from survey responses
based on first names, and used that information to summarize hiring
practices, demographics of successful grant applications, etc. However,
doing so is widely regarded as inappropriate due to non-binary genders
and inaccuracies in gender assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong>: Although statistical analysis and
figures/diagrams are very important in data science, this course will
not focus on those aspects because there are others in the College of
the Environment that do. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>FISH 454 - Ecological Modeling</p></li>
<li><p>FISH 458 - Modeling and Estimation in Conservation and Resource
Management</p></li>
<li><p>FISH 546 - Bioinformatics for Environmental Sciences</p></li>
<li><p>FISH 554 - Beautiful Graphics in R</p></li>
<li><p>QERM 514 - Analysis of Ecological and Environmental Data</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
</div>

<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="classroom-conduct" class="section level1">
<h1>Classroom conduct</h1>
<p>I am dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive learning
environment for all students, regardless of their background, identity,
physical appearance, or manner of communication. Any form of language or
behavior used to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort will not be
tolerated. All course participants (instructor, students, guests) are
expected to abide by the <a
href="https://fish.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2022/11/SAFSCodeOfConduct_Sept2022.pdf">SAFS
Code of Conduct</a>. In order to foster a positive and professional
learning environment, I ask the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Please let me know if you have a name or set of preferred
pronouns that you would like me to use; and</p></li>
<li><p>Please let me know if <em>anyone</em> in class says something
that makes you feel uncomfortable<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, I encourage the following kinds of behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use welcoming and inclusive language</p></li>
<li><p>Show courtesy and respect towards others</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge different viewpoints and experiences</p></li>
<li><p>Gracefully accept constructive criticism</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although I strive to create and use inclusive materials in this
course, there may be overt or covert biases in the course material due
to the lens with which it was written. Your suggestions about how to
improve the value of diversity in this course are encouraged and
appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong>: If you believe you have been a victim
of an alleged violation of the <a
href="https://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/WAC/478-121TOC.html">Student
Conduct Code</a> or you are aware of an alleged violation of the <a
href="https://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/WAC/478-121TOC.html">Student
Conduct Code</a>, you have the right to <a
href="https://www.washington.edu/cssc/for-students-2/">report it to the
University</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="access-accommodations" class="section level1">
<h1>Access &amp; accommodations</h1>
<p>All students deserve access to the full range of learning
experiences, and the University of Washington is committed to creating
inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal
and state laws. If you feel like your performance in class is being
impacted by your experiences outside of class, please talk with me.</p>
<div id="disabilities" class="section level3">
<h3>Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you have already established accommodations with Disability
Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved
accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your
needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through
DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that
requires accommodations (<em>e.g.</em>, mental health, learning, vision,
hearing, physical impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at
206-543-8924 or via <a href="mailto:uwdrs@uw.edu">email</a> or their <a
href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/">website</a>. DRS offers
resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with
disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable
accommodations are established through an interactive process between
you, your instructor(s) and DRS.</p>
</div>
<div id="religious-observances" class="section level3">
<h3>Religious observances</h3>
<p>Students who expect to miss class or assignments as a consequence of
their religious observance will be provided with a reasonable
accommodation to fulfill their academic responsibilities. Absence from
class for religious reasons does not relieve students from
responsibility for the course work required during the period of
absence. It is the responsibility of the student to provide the
instructor with advance notice of the dates of religious holidays on
which they will be absent. Students who are absent will be offered an
opportunity to make up the work, without penalty, within a reasonable
time, as long as the student has made prior arrangements.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="technology" class="section level1">
<h1>Technology</h1>
<p>This course will revolve around hands-on computing exercises that
demonstrate the topics of interest. Therefore, students are strongly
recommended to bring their own laptop to class, although students are
certainly free to work with one another. <strong>For students without
access to a personal laptop</strong>: it is possible to check out UW
laptops for an entire quarter (see the <a
href="https://education.uw.edu/admissions/office-of-student-services">Student
Services office</a> for details).</p>
<p>All of the software we will be using is free and platform
independent, meaning students may use macOS, Linux, or Windows operating
systems. In addition to a web browser, we will be using the free <a
href="https://www.r-project.org/"><strong>R</strong></a> software and
the desktop version of the <a
href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-desktop/"><strong>R
Studio</strong></a> integrated development environment (IDE). We will
also be using various packages not contained in the base installation of
<strong>R</strong>, but we will wait and install them at the necessary
time. The instructor will be available during the first week of class to
help students troubleshoot any software installation problems.</p>
<p>We will be using <a
href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"><strong>Git</strong></a>, a free
and open source version control system for tracking changes to our
files.</p>
<p>We will be using <a
href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/"><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></a>
to create and access relational databases.</p>
<p>Students will also be required to have a user account on <a
href="https://github.com/"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>, which we will be
using for file hosting and communications via “issues”. If you do not
already have an account, you can sign up for a free one <a
href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">here</a>. The
instructor will provide training on how to use the intended features in
<strong>GitHub</strong>.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="teaching-methodology" class="section level1">
<h1>Teaching methodology</h1>
<p>This course will introduce new material primarily through prepared
slides and hands-on demonstrations. Students will be expected to work
both individually and collaboratively (to the extent possible given the
current conditions); course content and evaluation will emphasize the
communication of ideas and the ability to think critically more so than
a specific pathway or method. Other areas of this website provide an
overview of the topics to be covered, including links to weekly reading
assignments, lecture materials, computer labs, and homework
assignments.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="communication" class="section level1">
<h1>Communication</h1>
<p>This course will involve a <em>lot</em> of communication between and
among students and the instructor. Short questions should be addressed
to me via email; I will try my best to respond to your message within 24
hours. Under more normal circumstances, detailed questions would be
addressed to me in person–either after class or during a scheduled
meeting. In this case, however, we will schedule one-on-one or group
Zoom calls as needed.</p>
<p>In addition to email and Zoom, we will use the “Issues” feature in
<strong>GitHub</strong> to ask questions and assist others.
Specifically, questions and answers can be posted to the issues in the
course’s “assistance” repository <a
href="https://github.com/FISH497/assistance/issues">here</a>.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="evaluation" class="section level1">
<h1>Evaluation</h1>
<p>Students will be evaluated on their knowledge of course content and
their ability to communicate their understanding of the material via
individual homework assignments (80%) and their active participation in
class (20%). There will be 8 homework assignments, each counting toward
10% of the final grade. Please note, <strong>all assignments must be
turned in to achieve a passing grade</strong>.</p>
<div id="homework" class="section level3">
<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>Homework will be assigned each Friday of weeks 2-9 and will be due by
11:59 PM 9 days later on the following Sunday (weeks 3-10). The
instructor will evaluate and return student homework assignments within
one week of their due date. <strong>If for some reason you cannot meet
the homework deadline, contact the instructor as soon as possible to
discuss other options</strong>. Please see the <a
href="homework.html">Homework</a> page for more details.</p>
</div>
<div id="participation" class="section level3">
<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>Data science is about communicating your ideas and findings to
others. As such, this course will require students to engage with the
instructor and one another in small groups. I expect all students to
contribute to our discussions of concepts, results, bugs/errors,
etc.</p>
<p>Students should discuss any potential schedule conflicts with the
instructor during the first week of class.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level1">
<h1>Academic integrity</h1>
<p>Faculty and students at the University of Washington are expected to
maintain the highest standards of academic conduct, professional
honesty, and personal integrity. Plagiarism, cheating, and other
academic misconduct are serious violations of the <a
href="https://www.washington.edu/cssc/for-students/academic-misconduct/">Student
Conduct Code</a>. I have no reason to believe that anyone will violate
the Student Conduct Code, but <em>I will have no choice</em> but to
refer any suspected violation(s) to the College of the Environment for a
Student Conduct Process hearing. Students who have been guilty of a
violation will receive zero points for the assignment in question.</p>

<h1>Food Pantry</h1>
<p>No student should ever have to choose between buying food or
textbooks. The UW Food Pantry helps mitigate the social and academic
effects of campus food insecurity. They aim to lessen the financial
burden of purchasing food by providing students access to shelf-stable
groceries, seasonal fresh produce, and hygiene products at <strong>no
cost</strong>. Students can expect to receive 4 to 5 days’ worth of
supplemental food support when they visit the Pantry, located on the
north side of Poplar Hall at the corner of NE 41<sup>st</sup> St and
Brooklyn Ave NE. Visit the <a href="https://uw.edu/anyhungryhusky">Any
Hungry Husky website</a> for additional information, including operating
hours and additional food support resources.</p>
